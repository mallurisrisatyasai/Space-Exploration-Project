    <h2>History & Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Virgin Galactic, founded in 2004 by Sir Richard Branson, is a British space tourism company that aims to provide suborbital spaceflights to the public. The company uses its SpaceShipTwo, a winged spacecraft, launched from WhiteKnightTwo, a carrier aircraft, to take passengers to space. Virgin Galactic has been at the forefront of the commercial spaceflight revolution.

    <h2>Astronauts</h2>
    <p>
      Virgin Galactic has begun taking private individuals into space as astronauts. This includes high-profile flights such as that of Richard Branson, the company’s founder, who flew on SpaceShipTwo during its successful test flight in 2021, alongside other passengers. Sirisha Bandla, an Indian-American telugu aeronautical engineer and Vice President of Government Affairs at Virgin Galactic, who conducted a science experiment during the flight. Beth Moses, Virgin Galactic’s Chief Astronaut Instructor, who assessed the cabin experience for future passengers, were part of these milestone flights. The company is opening up space tourism to the general public, offering opportunities for civilians to become astronauts.
